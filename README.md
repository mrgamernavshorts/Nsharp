My OWN programming language updated!

there is a app named "N#" which is the compiler.

you have to create a txt file and then type in the name of the txt file in the"N#" program.

write the code in the txt file.

the code format has also changed.the old 2 functions are still there.

you just need to write the code in the txt file and save.

and also repeat the steps that were written above.

for documentation,check the readme file of this repository:

update:v1.1 released!what is new?:

      1.now you can write the code like this-
      
        write:hi
        
      instead of-
      
        write:
        
        hi
        
      2.now you can use 2 lines of the text and both functions instead of only one at time.ex:
      
        write:hi
        
        createvar:hello
