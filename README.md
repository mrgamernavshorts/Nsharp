My OWN programming language updated!

there is a app named "N#" which is the compiler.

you have to create a txt file and then type in the name of the txt file in the"N#" program.

write the code in the txt file.

the code format has also changed.the old 2 functions are still there.

you just need to write the code in the txt file and save.

and also repeat the steps that were written above.

update:v1.2 released!what is new?:

new functions added!

these are the new functions:

      printvar:
      add:num1:
      add:num2:
      addrun:
      sub:num1:
      sub:num2:
      subrun:
      multi:num1:
      multi:num2:
      multirun:
      div:num1:
      div:num2:
      divrun:
      createvar:input:
      
how do they work?

with this function,now you don't need to print the variable as you had created it.

      printvar:

enter the first number you want to add
      
      add:num1:
      
enter the second number you want to add

      add:num2:
      
prints the output of the addition between num1 and num2

      addrun:
      
these also run similarly:

      sub:num1:
      sub:num2:
      subrun:
      multi:num1:
      multi:num2:
      multirun:
      div:num1:
      div:num2:
      divrun:

this function stores the variable's value through input which is runned when the program is running(in N# compiler):

     createvar:input:
     
update:v1.1 released!what is new?:

1.now you can write the code like this-
      
      write:hi
        
instead of-
      
      write:
      hi
        
2.now you can use 2 lines of the text and both functions instead of only one at time.ex:
      
      write:hi
      createvar:hello

hope you like it.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
