My OWN programming language updated!

there is a app named "N#" which is the compiler.

you have to create a txt file and then type in the name of the txt file in the"N#" program.

write the code in the txt file.

the code format has also changed.the old 2 functions are still there.

you just need to write the code in the txt file and save.

and also repeat the steps that were written above.

update:v1.2 released!what is new?:

new functions added!

these are the new functions:

     write:hello
     createvar:hehe
     printvar:
     add:num1:
     add:num2:
     addrun:
     sub:num1:
     sub:num2:
     subrun:
     multi:num1:
     multi:num2:
     multirun:
     div:num1:
     div:num2:
     divrun:
     createvar:input:
     printvar:
      
update:v1.1 released!what is new?:

1.now you can write the code like this-
      
      write:hi
        
instead of-
      
      write:
      hi
        
2.now you can use 2 lines of the text and both functions instead of only one at time.ex:
      
      write:hi
      createvar:hello

hope you like it.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
